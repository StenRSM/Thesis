They always support my nerdy interests  Feeling so lucky to have them in my life     Just finished writing a short story about a group of scientists who discover a new planet. Feeling inspired by the possibilities of space exploration     Spotted the most breathtaking meteor shower last night!  The universe is truly magical        Feeling so grateful for all the beauty and wonder that exists beyond our planet  ‚ú®     Spending quality time with my friends today, discussing our favorite sci-fi movies. Feeling nerdy and proud!     The leaves are starting to change colors! Fall is my favorite season    Feeling inspired by the vibrant hues of nature     Just finished reading a thought-provoking article about the search for extraterrestrial life. Feeling hopeful for the future of space exploration     Feeling overwhelmed by all the unread articles in my science journal subscriptions. Taking a break for some mental relaxation!     This laundry pile is never-ending! But feeling accomplished after getting some chores done     Can't decide what to watch next... Any recommendations for a documentary about the history of astronomy? #SpaceNerd     Feeling so grateful for my curiosity and my thirst for knowledge. Just finished reading a book about the origins of the universe  Feeling like a lifelong learner     Finally finished organizing my entire astronomy book collection!
